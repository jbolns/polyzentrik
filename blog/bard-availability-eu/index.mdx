### Today broke our hearts.

Today's main agenda item was to give [Bard](https://bard.google.com/) a go for its money. We will unfortunately not be able to do it because while [Bard is now available in 180 countries and territories](https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13575153), EU countries were left out, [presumably due to the direction AI policies have taken in this continent](https://www.pcgamer.com/google-wont-tell-anyone-why-its-withholding-bard-ai-from-the-eu/).

### The big ethical problem.
We are sad partly because this made our day unnecessarily harder but also because it may foretell catastrophic news for AI ethics and sustainability alike.

Unlike competitors, [Bard promises traceability and referencing](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-bard-updates-io-2023/). You may know by now referencing is a major concern when it comes to large language models (LLMs). We have highlighted the matter as part of our experiments using LLMs to generate sustainability content ([here](./blog/sustainable-coffee-behind-scenes/) and [here](./blog/prompt-anchoring-chaining/)). If an LLM can't quote, it can be used for general marketing copy material but not for the in-depth content commonly needed in sustainability.

Bard is a new product, and traceability/referencing is hard even for humans. Obviously, room for improvement is next-to-guaranteed. Yet, we were looking forward to it because other LLMs in the market are not even trying to address the traceability/referencing conundrum.

Additionally, we do think Google is approaching AI in a way that seems significantly more concerned with AI and sustainability than many competitors.

Yet, the joke goes, [while penguins can now access Google Bard, people in the EU cannot](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-bard-european-union):

> Nobody in the EU can access Google’s Bard chatbot. But the 50,000 penguins who live on a dormant volcano in the South Atlantic can sign up right now.

So, we are now in a position where we can easily access models that do not seem to care too much about AI ethics but not those trying to approach AI ethically – the opposite of what is needed!

### EU's AI policies are probably at fault.
The reasons are, of course, undisclosed. No one truly knows why Bard's list of available territories does not include EU countries.

Still, **what do EU countries have that other countries in the list of Bard available territories do not have?**

The answer, unfortunately, is that the EU has or is about to have AI policies that are perhaps well-intended but suffer from fundamental design flaws.

### What now?

It is an absolute pity that AI regulations in the EU seem to be proving better at deterring good AI models than stopping bad ones. Sad. Just sad.

What are our alternatives?

* Use models that do not seem to care as much about ethics
* Use a VPN to access Bard
* Move out of the EU?

It's hard to see a happy ending.
