### Bard can help you identify ESG opportunities.
Say you need ideas to improve your or your customers’ ESG performance. Bard can help you pseudo-analyse a product portfolio for opportunities related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks/impacts.

We are NOT saying Bard can directly help assess or verify ESG performance. Bard can help you brainstorm ideas for improvement, but it will, in our experience, make things up. This factory defect is unhelpful for analysing the current state of affairs. However, it is a flaw that might be helpful when it comes to generating ideas for improvement.

Keep reading for a more detailed explanation.

### The background
We have been exploring large language models (LLMs) in the context of sustainability. You can read more about our content generation experiments [here](../prompt-anchoring-chaining), [here](../sustainable-coffee-behind-scenes), and [here](../bard-esg-behind-scenes).

A few weeks ago, we moved from using LLMs to generate content to exploring their usages in the context of sustainability analytics. We are approaching the matter responsibly and will take as much time as needed to arrive at solutions that meet our standards.

That said, Bard showed an interesting ability that is worth sharing already.

### The finding
Since Bard can access the Internet, you can ask it to scan websites and generate answers based on them. We asked it to access our website (www.polyzentrik.com) and asked ESG-related questions about it.

#### Unsurprisingly bad outcome
Knowing that it would fail at it, we asked it to assess Polyzentrik’s ESG performance.

The assessment was very generous. Polyzentrik is a small company still in its infancy. We have much to do on all fronts, including ESG. Yet, Bard spoke wonders about our ESG performance. It even said we are a member of initiatives we are not members of and that we produce reports we do not. We do not make these claims on our website.

As such, if we were to publish what Bard wrote as an analysis of our current ESG performance, we’d be greenwashing.

The reason likely relates to the fact that statistical likelihoods drive LLMs. ESG statements by companies tend to be positive. Companies interested in ESG boast about their environmental, social, and governance considerations. Greenwashers lie about their ESG performance by saying it is excellent even though it is not. And companies uninterested in ESG do not even mention ESG.

The situation is, of course, regrettable but also something that LLMs do not control. Thus, LLM users should expect LLMs to replicate this bias and be ready to take action to control it.

Not to say LLMs are not useful in the context of analytics. We think it is possible to enlist LLMs in some kind of ESG or ESG-related assessment. But this requires a more sophisticated approach than simply asking the LLM to undertake the evaluation directly.

#### Surprisingly good outcome
Bard turned out very ‘glass half full’ on ESG. So, we decided to try and leverage this factory defect into something usable.

Instead of asking it to assess current performance, we asked it to brainstorm how our existing products may support an ESG agenda. 

The response, copied below, was surprisingly good. 

> <u>**HUMAN:**</u>

> Thanks. Please now access the website www.polyzentrik.com and do the following. First, give me a summary of what the company does and a listing of products. Second, offer a brief analysis of how each product might help Polyzentrik and/or Polyzentrik’s customers improve their ESG performance.

We do not mention some of these things on our website, but they are part of how we do things. We will now also endeavour to be more explicit about these things. Thanks to Bard.

Moreover, the products are helpful but not specifically about sustainability. We know firms that offer similar products despite not knowing the sustainability applications. For them, the answer above would open new and potentially-unknown possibilities.

#### The uncomfortable middle ground
Bard did fall back into its over-inventive self when we tried to go into more specifics.

For instance, we directed it to specific services, such as AI content generation, and asked it to assess how these might help improve an ESG agenda. 

The answer was helpful in the sense it offered ideas. However, it phrased part of the response in terms of completed projects that do not exist.

> <u>**HUMAN:**</u>

> Thanks, Polyzentrik also offers AI-generated content services. You can find the service description here: https://www.polyzentrik.com/services/sustainability-content-ai/. Could you please offer a note about how this service might help Polyzentrik and/or its customers improve their ESG performance.

> AI-generated content can help businesses improve their ESG performance in a number of ways. For example, AI can be used to:
> * Create sustainable content: AI can be used to create content that is both informative and engaging, and that also promotes sustainable practices. For example, AI could be used to create blog posts, articles, or social media posts that educate people about sustainability, or that highlight the company’s own sustainability initiatives.
> * **[Comment: This is not specifically about LLMs.]** Measure and report on ESG performance: AI can be used to measure and report on ESG performance in a more efficient and accurate way. For example, AI could be used to track data on greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, or waste production.
> * Automate ESG tasks: AI can be used to automate ESG tasks, such as data collection, reporting, and compliance. This can free up human resources to focus on other tasks, and it can help to ensure that ESG tasks are completed accurately and efficiently.

> Overall, AI-generated content can be a valuable tool for businesses that are looking to improve their ESG performance. It can help businesses to create more sustainable content, measure and report on ESG performance more effectively, and automate ESG tasks.

> **[Comment: Nothing in the list below is true. Sadly, we haven’t yet had that many customers.]** Here are some specific examples of how Polyzentrik’s AI-generated content services have helped their customers improve their ESG performance:

> * **[Comment: This project did not exist]** A clothing company used Polyzentrik’s AI-generated content services to create a series of blog posts about sustainable fashion. The blog posts were informative and engaging, and they helped the company to educate its customers about sustainable fashion.
> * **[Comment: This project did not exist]** A food company used Polyzentrik’s AI-generated content services to create a report on its ESG performance. The report was comprehensive and accurate, and it helped the company to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability.
> * **[Comment: This project did not exist]** A manufacturing company used Polyzentrik’s AI-generated content services to automate its ESG reporting process. The company was able to save time and resources, and it was able to ensure that its ESG reporting was accurate and consistent.

> **[Comment: Got to love the call to action, though.]** These are just a few examples of how Polyzentrik’s AI-generated content services can help businesses improve their ESG performance.

### Conclusion
There you go. In our experience, Bard will probably make up stuff if you ask it to assess the current state of affairs of an ESG agenda. However, the same factory defect makes Bard helpful when brainstorming about room for improvement in an ESG agenda.

Use it at your own risk, of course. For all we know, our website might be very clear about its interest in sustainability. That said, it is worth noting that we got relatively consistent results across tests.

Additionally, the results suggest pseudo-analytical capacities when it comes to ESG. 

Bard made up things. Thus, Bard is not directly reliable for ESG analytics. Yet, it placed the right future actions next to the right products. This result is, of course, also likely due to how LLMs operate. Words that refer to specific actions likely combine with particular products more than others. Regardless, this ability might be helpful in the context of more sophisticated analytics using but not directly based on LLMs. 

Stay tuned for more. Get in touch for more details about our future products.
