While the term is increasingly popular, the meaning of digital sustainability remains unclear.

### What?
Polyzentrik’s view is that digital sustainability is a cyclical challenge. Digital sustainability is about using digital technologies to help organisations be sustainable. This implies digital sustainability is also about sustainably implementing digital technologies.

### Why?
The difference with existing definitions of digital sustainability is only an explicit separation of goal (digital technologies for sustainability) and implementation (sustainable digital technologies).

Currently, the most popular definition of digital sustainability is the Chicago-based Mightybytes. [They define digital sustainability](https://www.mightybytes.com/blog/digital-sustainability-how-to-get-started-today/) as “the process of applying social, economic, and environmental stewardship principles to digital products, services, and data delivered via the internet”. 

Another popular definition is by Cybercom Group, a Swedish IT consultancy recently acquired by Knowit. [In their view](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59dc930532601e9d148e3c25/t/5a2c97b5e4966be66fae2716/1512871882345/Cybercom-Digital-Sustianability-full+report.pdf), “digital sustainability is an approach that harnesses one of the most powerful forces for societal change, namely digitalisation, to deliver what we need and want in a sustainable way”.

More definitions exist. Most share an interest in using digital technologies to help organisations be more sustainable.

The need for such efforts is evident. [UNEP recently noted](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/measuring-progress-towards-achieving-environmental-dimension-sdgs) that there is currently not enough data to even assess progress for 68% of environment-related SDG indicators. [Researchers have noted](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3420297) ESG investment faces significant data gaps, disagreements, and discrepancies, and [ESG service providers](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2021/10/closing-the-disconnect-in-esg-data.html) are aware of many related challenges. SDGs and ESG practitioners are arguably leaders in digital sustainability. The situation across other sustainability subfields is likely similar, or worse.

Unfortunately, it is not enough to simply throw digital technologies at sustainability challenges. 

Digital technologies have a massive environmental impact. A [recent study](https://theshiftproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lean-ICT-Report_The-Shift-Project_2019.pdf) by The Shift Project places the emissions of digital technologies at 3.7 per cent of global emissions, with [other studies](https://en.reset.org/our-digital-carbon-footprint-environmental-impact-living-life-online-12272019/) placing the number somewhere between 1.8 and 3.2 per cent. By way of comparison, [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-aviation) estimates the aviation sector emits between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent of global emissions. If a digital sustainability effort does not keep its environmental impacts in mind, these might erase gains in other areas.

Additionally, a digital sustainability project unaware of its environmental impacts may also be unaware of organisational impacts. Digitalisation can be tricky for organisations, which can end up “[bogged down in the manual collection and management of (data)](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/news-and-media/esg-data-management/)” and lack time and resources to act. Also, [data literacy is key](https://www.qlik.com/us/bi/-/media/08F37D711A58406E83BA8418EB1D58C9.ashx). Untrained staff might be unable to act even if good information is available. A digital sustainability project unaware of organisational impacts is bound to struggle.

So, it seems helpful to explicitly recall digital sustainability involves, both, using digital technologies to improve how organisations go about sustainability and doing it sustainably.

### Profitability

The explicit interest in both aspects of digital sustainability also supports profitability.

Compliance failures can be expensive. Ensuring digital sustainability efforts deliver clear actionable information may help avoid unpleasant surprises, especially if these efforts also avoid creating or at least minimise new compliance risks.

Digitalisation can be costly. Ensuring digital sustainability efforts are efficient may help lower implementation and running costs.

Digital transformation can add significant organisational complexity. Being mindful of human impacts might, at once, improve the benefits delivered by and the longevity (just another word for sustainability) of a digital sustainability effort.

Organisations interested in digital sustainability might therefore benefit financially from explicitly recalling digital sustainability involves, both, using digital technologies for sustainability and doing it sustainably.
