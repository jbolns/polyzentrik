We took a little family time the past couple of weeks. 

Our goal was simply to enjoy, but we had time to think and learn a lesson in the process.

In sustainability and ESG, all roads lead to culture. 

An organisation may have the fanciest digital/data set-up, which does little if the priorities are not straight.

Our genuine advice. Start at home. Care for those you love and the society and planet they will inhabit (hopefully) long after you are gone. Then bring the same attitude with you when you go to work. 

Easy to say. Hard to achieve. Priorities do not just appear when most needed. They are what happens while we are busy doing other things. 

Practice makes perfect.
