Introducing [WEIRD](https://www.weird-project.com), a **multimodal web framework** able to produce websites from different types of documents, even Word documents.

### Use cases
WEIRD is both a no-code/low-code tool to make websites from documents (currently supported: .html, .md, .docx, and .docm) *and* a web framework developers can use to code multimodal websites.

It depends on how you use it.

* **No-code/low-code tool:** WEIRD comes with chat-based assistants anyone can use to easily build websites by answering questions and uploading documents/images. You could, in theory, build a website from Word documents alone. The formatting in Word (.docm) documents tends to come through. Given some trial and error, thus, Word could become your new 'WYSIWYG' editor.

* **Web-framework:** WEIRD's weird because it combines programming languages not often combined: Python, HTML/CSS/JS, and VBA. That said, WEIRD is coded in an onion-like manner that makes it possible for developers to customise WEIRD layer by layer. Web developers can personalise WEIRD websites using HTML, CSS, JS, and libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap. Python developers can tinker with the build process. VBA developers can play around with how WEIRD and Office communicate, paving the way for personalised interactions between their websites and Office documents.

* **Something in between:** Since document types can be combined, WEIRD is a way for coders (especially those with little time availability) to focus coding on key website sections while reducing the time needed to manage other sections. Alternatively, WEIRD might also be helpful in facilitating collaboration by teams with people from diverse technical backgrounds: some can upload code, others, Word documents.

Something else we like a lot about WEIRD is its ability to produce websites that are more sustainable than the average. Polyzentrik's founder J wanted a website that was far more sustainable than the average, but he also wanted to avoid hard-coding things (it gets very repetitive). WEIRD is the result of trying to find automated ways to code a highly sustainable website.

Not to say that all WEIRD websites will be sustainable. Usage matters. However, used well, WEIRD can produce fairly sustainable websites.

### Examples

**[WEIRD](https://weird.polyzentrik.com/)**
* WEIRD's public website was produced with WEIRD, of course.
* It is an example of the foundational type of website WEIRD produces without customisation. 

**[Dr J](https://www.josebolanos.xyz/)**
* Polyzentrik's J's website was made with a modified WEIRD that renders apps rather than websites. As we might have noted before, his site is also one of the most sustainable websites in the planet.
* It is an example of a website using WEIRD as a web framework with room for significant customisation.

### Give it a try!
You can download and try WEIRD from its [dedicated GitHub repo](https://github.com/jbolns/WEIRD). It's open source (Apache 2.0). We welcome voluntary payments if you choose to remove the branding.

Go on! You might like it. If WEIRD was a dog, it would be a stray dog. A nice one. With spots all over.

*Ps. WEIRD is best-suited for small-to-medium websites like, for instance, portfolios, project and landing pages, documentation, personal blogs, and some SME websites. For larger websites and/or websites requiring dynamic interactions between front and back end, you need something different. Furthermore, WEIRD's current version is Beta -7. We believe WEIRD can already be useful in many circumstances, but we also advice treating it as the experimental product that it is.*
