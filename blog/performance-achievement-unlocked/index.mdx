### Even Google thinks our page is a rocket!
We are absolutely thrilled! [Polyzentrik.com](/) achieved a [perfect Google’s PageSpeed Insights score](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-www-polyzentrik-com/brajlpfpul?form_factor=desktop).<sup>1</sup>

Performance is critical to lowering the environmental impact of websites. The optimisation leading into this score supports our example-first approach to digital sustainability. Additionally, the score evidences our commitment to websites that are, all, fast, beautiful, and sustainable.

### What is PageSpeed Insights?
Google’s [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev) is a leading website performance assessment. It measures four crucial factors impacting user experience: speed, accessibility, design, and search engine optimisation (SEO).

#### Speed
We care about our visitors’ time. 

We use a framework called [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Gatsby is an advanced version of React that prioritises performance. We have also improved beyond the initial Gatsby baseline. Image compression, transfer size management, self-hosted fonts, content delivery networks (CDNs), and more – it’s all there!

As a result, our website is very fast. Pages load in fractions of seconds.

#### Accessibility
We want everyone to access our website easily. So, we incorporated accessibility features across the website. 

For example, we religiously include alt tags. Also, we designed the page to be mindful of colour contrasts. Equally, much time has gone into ensuring the structure delivers a website that is easy to follow. Users have quick access to critical navigational components. Finally, we made a conscious decision to keep individual pages short. 

As a result, our website meets guidelines that aim to ensure an inclusive user experience. 

#### Design best practices
We also want to reduce potential vulnerabilities and minimise resource requirements. 

For instance, we use HTTPS and have avoided implementing anything in a way that leads to errors logged to the console. Additionally, Gatsby has been very helpful with image management. Furthermore, while Gatsby is based on React, the final (production) version of a Gatsby site is static, reducing potential vulnerabilities.

As a result, our site exemplifies what is possible when taking design best practices seriously.

#### SEO
SEO is no longer only about keywords. Website design now plays a crucial role in SEO.

We have thus implemented SEO best practices in our website design. All our pages, even blog posts, have rich and up-to-date meta tags. All images contain appropriate alt tags (even then social media icons on the header bar). Also, sitemaps are accurate and updated with every change, and links are descriptive and crawlable.

As a result, Google, the authority on web search, scored us 100 out of 100 in the SEO department.

### Conclusion
Polyzentrik follows a continuous improvement philosophy. The exact score may oscillate as we continue to test things and improve our website.

Regardless, we are very proud of the score. It testifies to our commitment to delivering exceptional websites that are good for both business and the environment.

We offer sustainable website design. And when we say sustainable, we also mean high-performance. A website even Google will like.

So, get in touch! You can also have a website that is fast, beautiful, and sustainable!
