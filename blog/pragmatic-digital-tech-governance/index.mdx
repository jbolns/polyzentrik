Efforts to govern digital technologies are driven by ideals worth supporting. It is worrying, however, that some salient actions seem to increasingly disconnect from reality.

We are trying to counter this tendency with a pragmatic approach to digital technologies driven by an interest in enabling specific but significant improvements. We welcome support. 

### Trends that worry
We are concerned about two trends that seem to mark an increasing disconnect between reality and the governance of digital technologies.

**Fear-driven regulatory capture.** 

Apocalyptic scenarios and absurd exaggerations are now commonplace in digital technology governance. Both things take attention from real and critical risks. Additionally, as [Le Cun](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1718670073391378694) and [Ng](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-220/) suggest, fearmongering can help incumbents lobby for regulations that make it harder for others to compete against them. 

The regulation of non-existing or exaggerated risks increases compliance costs to levels small businesses and open-source developers may not be able to afford, only to deliver nothing in return.

**Vacuous generality.** 

Something else that seems increasingly common is frameworks that cover a wide range of risks but are vacuous in that they do not offer much in the way of ideas, actions, or even support for those taking action to manage these risks.

An analogy to describe the futility of these frameworks is the idea of using a towel to remove water from a large tank. Even if the towel covers the whole container, it will let the water through. You are better off with a bucket.

Again, not all frameworks are vacuous. It does feel, however, that an increasing number are despite claiming to be comprehensive.

### Many small good things
Our approach to digital technologies is humbler than many other available. At the same time, it is pragmatic and can deliver tangible results.

The approach is straightforward, based on three common sense principles.
1. **Realistic risk identification.** Separating tangible risks from imaginary and apocalyptic visions is needed to focus on reality.
2. **Risk ranking.** While all risks are important, the harm potential and timelines of different risks differ, implying a need to rank them.
3. **Multi-pronged actions (many small good things).** A diversity of individual efforts addressing specific risks may yield more progress than centralised general-level efforts to reduce all risks.

For these reasons, we are creating resources addressing specific digital ethics and digital sustainability challenges that we believe are real and critical in the short term â€“ you can read more about them in our [resources section](../../resources/). 

### Get on board!
Admittedly, we are going at the speed of turtles due to a lack of financial resources. If we continue at this speed, it will take a hundred years.

But that is a different problem with several solutions.
* Steal our idea and do it faster!
* Get in touch and ask us how you can help us!
* Support us financially!

Anything goes, so long as it helps to deliver better and more sustainable digital technologies.
