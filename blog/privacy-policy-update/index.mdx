We joined the ranks of companies that have recently changed [privacy and Cookies policies](/terms-conditions/). 

Except, in our case, we changed them in a way that shows we care about your privacy.

#### The background
Polyzentrik has always cared about privacy. We use [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) on our website, which prioritises user experience over the ability to gather data. GatsbyJS combines React and GraphQL. The foundational website is essentially a React website. However, Gatsby [takes this website and produces a static version to serve users]( https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/static-site-generator/). 

Static websites are incredibly fast thanks to not needing to re-generate content every time a user visits a page. However, they do not have open server connections in the way a social media would, for example. They also do not rely on Cookies as heavily as other websites. Accordingly, while it is possible to collect data via a static website, it is a harder to do so than with a normal website.  

We like this. It motivates us to be minimalistic in our data consumption.

#### Trusting others and being true to ourselves
That said, we still had data maximalist policies. 

Due to inability to pay bespoke legal services, our policies are based on templates available online. These templates are commonly used across the Internet. For the same reason, however, they must cover numerous use cases and naturally maximise what website owners can do.

Notwithstanding the risk involved, we have decided to trust people and be more open about our ways of thinking, including privacy. 

We therefore adapted our policies accordingly. 

#### Limitations
A total rewrite is currently impossible. 

We changed aspects of the policies in a way we believe improves them. We cannot rewrite the entire policies because we do not (yet) have the kind of money needed to hire the type of lawyers that could help us do this.

Hopefully, this will change in the future if you help us get bigger customers.

#### The changes
The main changes are in our Cookies policy. In short, we clarified that **we do not currently use Cookies**. 

The body of the policy now specifies that our use of Cookies is truly minimal by listing out each and every way in which Cookies are used. Currently, no Cookies are used. The only partial exception are third-party Cookies when we embed content from other websites. This is very rare, and even these Cookies are blocked from rendering until the user specifically requests them – see an example [here](/blog/transcriptions-accuracy-example/).

Additionally, while the introductory sections of the Cookies policy remain standard to provide the necessary scaffolding for any future usage, the Cookies policy is tied to the GDPR/Privacy policy, which now includes an overall “need-to-know” philosophy to drive the use of Cookies:  

> Our use of Cookies is detailed in Our Cookies Policy. We approach Cookies on a “need-to-know” basis. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy You agree we may use Cookies to collect Your data. Cookies are needed in a wide variety of settings and, as such, We need to reserve the right to use Cookies. However, We do our best to minimise the use of Cookies and strive to only use Cookies to collect data we need (as opposed to collecting data indiscriminately “just in case” we can monetise it). The Cookies section contains information about the specific Data We currently collect via Cookies.

We would need to stretch the “need-to-know” philosophy significantly to rival the ways in which most other websites use Cookies. 

Finally, we have added context to aspects of the policies that did not read clearly. For example, websites often publish user-generated content or allow users to post content, which requires moderation. To enable this, the Terms and Conditions note the following: 

> “The Company further reserves the right to make formatting and edits and change the manner of any Content”. 

We added some context regarding how the right might be exercised: 

> “This right will not be used to intentionally change the meaning of Your input but is needed to ensure We can format and edit objectionable Content. An example is objectionable Content by a participant in a recorded event, which often cannot be removed without slightly altering/shortening statements by other participants…”.

#### Conclusion
There is a long road ahead. We really would like policies that are uniquely ours. However, we believe the changes have already delivered an improvement. We also believe that the result is policies that, while still imperfect, better match our views on privacy and data.

Please help us get customers so we can improve even further!
