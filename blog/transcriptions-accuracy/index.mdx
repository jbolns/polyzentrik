We recently launched AI transcription services. A common question about this type of service relates to the quality of the output. How accurate is the transcription?

Below is our somewhat-long but hand-over-heart honest answer.

### Editing is needed – as is typically the case
You will need to edit our AI transcripts. This is hardly rare. Anyone who has ever tried AI transcription will tell you, with some amount of frustration, that “you still have to edit it”.

Some options advertise as incredibly accurate. We can neither confirm nor deny, but we can tell you that third-party reviews say results vary significantly and can disappoint.

For example, this is an extract from [TechRadar’s review of a popular AI transcription service](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sonixai):  

> Given our testing, we’d describe this product as highly dependent on the quality of the recording and many other factors that can’t easily be controlled.

> When processing our classic historical speech recordings, it had real difficultly with some speakers even if they sounded clear to us.

> These results were in marked contrast to some more concurrent recordings, where the accuracy was acceptable but hardly stellar.

Alternatively, this is an extract of [PC Mag’s review of another popular provider](https://uk.pcmag.com/speech-recognition/93615/otter): 

> It’s a good thing Otter’s editing features are advanced because the raw transcribing power of the AI produced many errors in testing.

> […]

> Unfortunately, Otter’s performance in the simple audio test produced below-average results. It didn’t take the service long to transcribe the file, but the finished transcription had 18 errors. Only two other automated transcription services, Temi and Scribie, performed worse on the simple audio test.

Popular AI transcription services do provide value. Some perform well in some circumstances, and a few have beautiful user interfaces.

Regardless, editing is often necessary.

The amount of time needed for it depends on several factors. It is harder to transcribe a messy conversation with much background noise and many speakers talking at once than a clean and structured conversation with only a few speakers. Additionally, some providers offer the option of human oversight and can therefore provide minimal accuracy guarantees.

Costs add up very quickly, though. So, unless you have short audios or deep pockets, some amount of editing is unavoidable.

### Our approach
Polyzentrik is a digital sustainability firm. Sustainability involves long conversations, many of them. Things could get very expensive if we opted for maximal accuracy across all transcripts.

So, we do not guide ourselves by a single accuracy goal. 

Instead, we are developing several options with different cost/quality ratios. In that way, users can choose what fits them best.

The three currently available alternatives are:

* **Unstructured.** It outputs a simple transcript as a block of text or in small segments. There is no formatting, but we use Open AI’s Whisper, so the audio-to-text aspects of the transcription will be comparable to other market alternatives. Best for very tight budgets and dynamic conversations with many speakers.

* **Segmented.** It is slightly more computationally intensive than the structured option. It joins the text into paragraphs based on speaker changes and pauses. The result is imperfect, but it will get many things right and further reduce editing time. Best for structured conversations with multiple speakers or regular speaker changes and interruptions.

* **Diarisation.** It will guess the number of speakers in a conversation and then try to match speakers with statements. Best for clear conversations with clearly defined speakers.

### Give it a try!
Our introductory AI transcription prices are very accessible. We can also give you a free test if you need many transcriptions. 

So, give them a try! They could save you time and money.
