We are moving our AI transcription [scripts](https://github.com/jbolns/transcription) to a [digital ethics](../../resources/digital-ethics) resource. 

We initially categorised transcriptions as a digital sustainability asset because sustainability commonly involves oral interactions that need to be transcribed. 

That said, transcriptions are not unique to sustainability. They are, in fact, common across many sectors.

What makes transcriptions truly special, indeed what has caught our attention most in the past few months, is that they can contain a lot of personal identifiable information (PII, i.e., data that can be used to identify an individual) and even sensitive and confidential information.

### Not always problematic
Not to say all uses of transcription are a concern.

For instance, customer service calls do not necessarily contain a whole lot of PII. There is PII involved. Names, emails, bank accounts, and similar pieces of data. However, the PII involved is relatively easy to identify. Some providers therefore offer services that automatically remove these specific PII types.

### But, sometimes, very problematic
However, challenges arise when audios contain PII that is not easily removable and/or additional information that is sensitive or confidential. 

Research interviews are a good example. Interview participants often reveal numerous personal details and sensitive information such as political affiliation, sexual preferences, controversial opinions, histories about others, and so forth. Interviews can also include facts that are insignificant by themselves but very revealing when taken altogether.

Sending all that information to an unknown provider is tantamount to insanity. You could literally be giving someone what they need to deepfake/impersonate people. Using a known-and-reputable provider might be a better option. However, there is still a need for clarity and safeguards about how the data is being handled.

There is also the question of consent. Even if a provider is fully trustable, participants still have the right to know and consent to how their data is processed. This does not always happen nowadays, but it should. 

### When in doubt, go local
This is why our AI transcription resources fit perfectly in the digital ethics category.

We (accidentally) designed them to run locally. The original idea was to minimise costs â€“ leave your computer running overnight and wake up to transcripts that costed nothing.

It just so happens that local transcriptions avoid the need to send audios to an online service. 

If you are dealing with highly-sensitive conversations, do not know how your AI transcription provider handles audios' data, or do not have consent to send participants' data to a cloud-based provider, local transcriptions are the way to go (and, in some cases, comply with applicable regulations).

Our transcription resources can help you do just that. Read more about them [here](../../resources/local-transcriptions).
