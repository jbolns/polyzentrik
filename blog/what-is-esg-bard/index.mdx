### The meaning of ESG.
ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. ESG investors consider environmental, social, and governance factors when making investment decisions. They believe that companies committed to sustainability and responsible business practices are more likely to succeed long-term.

There are different ways to measure ESG performance. Common metrics include:
* Environmental metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and waste production
* Social metrics such as employee diversity, labour practices, and human rights
* [Corporate] Governance metrics include board diversity, executive compensation, and shareholder rights.

ESG investors can use these metrics to screen potential investments and weigh companies. A famous example is BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $9 trillion in assets under management. Vanguard, another large asset manager with over $6 trillion in assets under management, is also a notable example. But, many more examples are possible.

### Benefits of ESG investing
ESG is presumed to have significant benefits. 
* Higher returns – studies have shown that ESG-focused companies may have higher returns than non-ESG companies over the long term
* Reduced risk – ESG investing can help investors reduce risk by avoiding companies exposed to environmental, social, or governance risks
* Positive impact – ESG investing can positively impact the environment and society by supporting companies committed to sustainability and responsible business practices.

### ESG is gaining popularity
ESG investing is a growing trend. [Global sustainable assets under management reached $35.3 trillion in 2020, up from $22.9 trillion in 2016](https://www.gsi-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GSIR-20201.pdf). Furthermore, a growing body of research by actors such as [MSCI](https://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/integrating-esg-into-factor/0523543282) and the [World Economic Forum](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ESG_Report_digital_pages.pdf) suggests ESG may assist financial performance.

As the ESG movement continues to grow, more investors will likely consider ESG factors. ESG advocates believe this is good news for the environment and society, as it will help to encourage companies to adopt more sustainable practices.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, ESG investing is becoming increasingly popular amongst investors. ESG funds offer a way for investors to profit and support companies working to positively impact the environment, society, and governance. Many different ESG funds are available, so investors can choose one that meets their specific needs and goals.
