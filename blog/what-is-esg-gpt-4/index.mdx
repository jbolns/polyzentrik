Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) refers to a set of criteria used to evaluate a company's performance, impact, and management of environmental, social, and governance aspects. 

These criteria are considered by investors, stakeholders, and companies themselves to assess a company's sustainability, ethical practices, and overall contribution to society, as well as to identify potential risks and opportunities related to ESG factors.

ESG factors cover a wide range of issues within each dimension:
1.	Environmental factors include a company's carbon emissions, energy efficiency, natural resource conservation, waste management, and pollution control, among others.
2.	Social factors encompass labor practices, employee health and safety, diversity and inclusion, human rights, community engagement, and customer satisfaction.
3.	Governance factors involve corporate governance practices, board composition, executive compensation, shareholder rights, business ethics, and regulatory compliance.

By incorporating ESG criteria into their decision-making processes, companies can better manage their internal operations and external impacts on society and the environment. This, in turn, can lead to improved financial performance, enhanced reputation, and long-term value creation for both the company and its stakeholders.

Investors use ESG factors to make more informed investment decisions and identify companies that are better positioned to navigate the challenges and opportunities arising from environmental, social, and governance issues.

ESG has gained significant momentum in recent years, with more investors, companies, and stakeholders recognizing the importance of incorporating these factors into their decision-making processes. Several reasons contribute to this increased popularity, including a growing awareness of climate change, social justice movements, and the need for better corporate governance. 

According to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA), sustainable investments grew by 34% between 2016 and 2018, reaching $30.7 trillion in assets under management globally. This upward trend has continued, with a record $51.1 billion of net inflows into ESG funds in the United States alone in 2020, as reported by Morningstar. *[A sentence was edited out due to issues GPT-4 could not address to our satisfaction].*

This growing interest in ESG is expected to drive further integration of sustainability considerations into corporate strategies, investment portfolios, and regulatory frameworks, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable global economy.

<p class="small">1. This post was generated entirely by GPT-4, as part of Polyzentrik's exploration of whether AI can help communicate sustainability without the need for explicit re-writing. Not to say generating sustainability content with AI is easy or perhaps even advisable. A follow-up will see into the somewhat-frustrating process underneath. Spoiler alert: generative AI can assist digital sustainability if handled extremely carefully, but it can also mean troubles. In fact, despite having read it several times, J, Polyzentrik's founder, is still worried he might have missed something – do scream at him if so.</p>
