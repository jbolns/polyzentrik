Ando and I are currently working to bring you a website that is, all, fast, beautiful, and sustainable. 

Why beautiful? It makes sense that we want the website to be sustainable. Polyzentrik is a digital sustainability initiative. 
Yet, the importance of the website also being beautiful is not obvious.

The answer is threefold.

The **first** reason is marketing. We need customers. A nice website seems a good first step.

The **second** reason is that sustainability and aesthetics go hand in hand. In fact, as the 
[Smithsonian Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/in-defense-of-the-blobfish-why-the-worlds-ugliest-animal-isnt-as-ugly-as-you-think-it-is-6676336/) reminds us, 
even the world's ugliest animal, the Blobfish, looks alright in its natural habitat. Its appearance changes due to the effect of extreme pressures.

Finally, the **third** reason is that we want to dispel a digital sustainability myth. 
Many believe digital spaces like a website cannot be both easy on the eyes and sustainable. 
We want to show this is a myth. A fast performant and decidedly-good-looking website can also be sustainable.

We will cut this blog post short, thus, to keep working on the site. That said, we promise we will also be writing some very cool content.

So, do follow us on social media to stay in touch.
