LOKAL (transcriptions) is a user-friendly AI app to easily perform transcriptions on regular computers, including laptops.

Final quality is comparable with many on-cloud alternatives.

### Cost- and privacy-aware
Transcriptions can be quite expensive, to the tune of hundreds or even thousands of $/€/£. Additionally, sending audios to total strangers poses significant privacy risks, up to and including the potential for deepfakes. 

LOKAL can help you **save money** and **reduce risk exposure** by enabling you to undertake transcriptions locally on your own computer.

### User-friendly
Despite being an AI application, LOKAL is also very user-friendly.
* **Easy to install.** A one-click standalone (Windows) installation file is available. Download, click, install, run – that's all it takes.
* **Versatile.** Alternatively, you can *also* use LOKAL as a pure Python app.
* **Easy to use**. LOKAL was designed with user experience in mind. Guidance is available, but you may not even need it.
* **Widely compatible**. LOKAL has been tested with satisfactory speed and impressive quality on a good (CORE i7, 16MB RAM) yet affordable (€500) computer, and longer waiting times but still high-quality outputs on an entry-level (Pentium Gold, 4GB RAM) laptop.

### Open-source
LOKAL v1.0.0-alpha is released under an Apache 2.0 open-source license.

We ask you to [make a small voluntary payment via our website](https://www.polyzentrik.com/help-us-help/) if you are using LOKAL for paid, funded, commercial, or profitable research, non-governmental, governmental, or business activities. It would help us develop LOKAL further. 

That said, the software is yours to use at the lowest cost point needed to achieve your goals while reducing risk exposure.

Also, students, even funded PhD students, are encouraged not to even consider making any kind of voluntary payment.


### Download LOKAL
