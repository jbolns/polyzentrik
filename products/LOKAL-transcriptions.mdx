LOKAL (transcriptions) is an open-source AI app to easily perform transcriptions on regular computers, including laptops and personal computers.

Quality is on-par with on-cloud alternatives. Commercial use is possible.

### Benefits
LOKAL offers high-quality transcriptions, at low cost, and with privacy in mind. 
* **Low cost.** Payment is voluntary.
* **High quality.** LOKAL uses industry-standard state-of-the-art multilingual models. Quality is on-par with on-cloud alternatives
* **Privacy-aware.** Since transcription happens in your computer, privacy risks are reduced.<sup>1</sup> It is also possible to run LOKAL offline.<sup>2</sup>
* **Open-source.** Code is transparent. Commercial use is possible.

### User-friendly
LOKAL was designed with the user in mind.
* **Easy to install.** A one-click (Windows) installation file is available. Download, click, install. As easy as that.
* **Easy to use**. The user interface is very clean. Guidance is available, but you might not even need it.
* **Widely compatible**. LOKAL has been tested with satisfactory speed and impressive quality on a good (CORE i7, 16MB RAM) yet affordable (â‚¬500) computer, and longer waiting times but still high-quality outputs on an entry-level (Pentium Gold, 4GB RAM) laptop.

### Open-source license
LOKAL (transcriptions) is released under an Apache 2.0 open source license. The code is available via [GitHub](https://github.com/jbolns/lokal_transcriptions). 

LOKAL implements a voluntary activation approach. Core functionality works regardless of whether LOKAL is activated. Activation enables visual styles. Activation is also needed to keep the user interface pretty after five trial transcriptions.

Activation is possible using the invoice number you get after [making a small voluntary payment](https://www.polyzentrik.com/help-us-help/).

### Download LOKAL
LOKAL (transcriptions) is available via [GitHub](https://github.com/jbolns/lokal_transcriptions). Detailed installation and usage instructions are available there.

<hr />
<p className='small m-0'><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p className='small m-0'>1. LOKAL can help you manage privacy by: reducing the need to send audios to third-parties, allowing you to run transcriptions while momentarily offline, enabling you to run transcriptions on an isolated computer completely disconnected from the Internet. Having said that, LOKAL is not a guarantee of privacy, and you accept this when agreeing to the terms and conditions and by using LOKAL.</p>
<p className='small m-0'>2. An Internet connection is needed for initial model download. The first time you choose a model, the model needs to download. After, it is possible to perform transcriptions offline. Resetting models is possible from within LOKAL, which deletes all models in memory and forces a re-download next time a model is used.</p>
