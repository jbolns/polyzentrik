This project produced a course syllabus for an introductory mini-course to digital sustainability suitable for to student, managers, policymaker, and even programmer audiences. The course can be implemented as given, expanded, or condensed into a shorter seminar. 

Outputs are now available as open-source resources via [GitHub](https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101).

### Justification
A key aspect of the course is that it emphasises the connection between doing digital things sustainably and the ability to save and/or make money while from it.

A challenge with sustainability is the preconception that sustainability is expensive. This is NOT the case with digital sustainability. At the moment, actions that reduce the the footprint of digital activities also have the potential to enable significant money savings. Additionally, there is significant market demand for digital solutions that tackle sustainability problems.

This course therefore aims to motivate sustainability actions by emphasising its benefits on both the environmental and monetary fronts.

### Status
While we want to improve it further, we believe the syllabus can already help produce (or at the very least motivate) better and more sustainable digital technologies. 

We have therefore open-sourced it via GitHub: [https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101](https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101).

The [license](https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101/blob/main/LICENSE-2.0.txt) and copyright [NOTICE](https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101/blob/main/NOTICE.txt) are also available on GitHub.

### Usage
**Guided implementation services.** We can and are happy to help universities, companies, and/or organisations implement this syllabus as part of their teaching/training. Prices vary. 

**External usage.** Alternatively, others can use the syllabus on their own as specified in the license.

### Feedback
We also welcome feedback and literature suggestions to potentially add in future revisions. Please submit any feedback by creating an issue on the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101), ideally in a way that we can easily approve/reject the change.
