This project produced a course syllabus for an introductory mini-course to digital sustainability suitable for students, managers, policymakers, and even programmers. The course can be implemented as given, expanded, or condensed. 

Outputs are now available as open-source resources via [GitHub](https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101).

### Justification
A vital aspect of the course is that it emphasises the connection between doing digital things sustainably and the ability to save and/or make money from it.

A challenge with sustainability is the preconception that sustainability is expensive. This is NOT the case with digital sustainability. At the moment, actions that reduce the footprint of digital activities can also potentially enable significant money savings. Additionally, market demand for digital solutions that tackle sustainability problems is substantial.

This course therefore aims to motivate sustainability actions by emphasising its benefits on both the environmental and monetary fronts.

### Status
While we want to improve it further, we believe the syllabus can already help produce (or, at the very least, motivate) better and more sustainable digital technologies. We have therefore open-sourced it via GitHub: [https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101](https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101).
