We are working on a website foundation (or starter pack) (call it however you want to call it) that we hope becomes one of the most sustainable departing points for creating Gatsby websites.

The foundation aims to help Gatsby developers build or get ideas to create more sustainable websites and tease developers using other approaches.

The project is operational, meaning, roughly, that we have developed the thing and are testing it – more details below.

### Justification
As estimated by the Website Carbon Calculator, ['the average web page tested produces approximately 0.5 grams CO2 per page view'](https://www.websitecarbon.com/). There are [hundreds of millions of active websites](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/website-statistics/) and many more to come. Emissions add up. 

Since each website constitutes only a tiny part of the problem, it would be naive to expect individual website owners to single-handedly do everything it takes to make a website sustainable. There are time, cost, and knowledge barriers to consider. 

Website owners need resources that make it easier for them to make their websites more sustainable in a cost-efficient manner. These resources also need to consider the need for websites to be visually appealing.

GatsbyJS is a robust framework for building sustainable websites. It is based on React, so it can handle almost everything you throw at it. That said, it ultimately generates static websites, which can be very sustainable (for numerous reasons). This is not to say that GatsbyJS websites are automatically sustainable. Much can be lost in implementation. 

We therefore aim to produce a GatsbyJS foundation that shows what GatsbyJS can achieve if used with sustainability in mind.

### Status
This project is currently operational. We have developed the foundation. We are now testing it and can already implement it as part of client projects. 

You are, in fact, looking at an implementation, i.e., this website – source code [here](https://github.com/jbolns/polyzentrik).

We aim to publish an open-access version of our current implementation not including company and personal details. That said, we are still undergoing tests and polishing things. So, meanwhile, please do not use without explicit permission.
