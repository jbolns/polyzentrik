### Introduction
We are working on a website foundation (or starter pack) (or distribution) (call it however you want to call it) that we hope becomes one of the if not *the* most sustainable base for creating websites. 

The foundation aims to help Gatsby developers build or get ideas to build more sustainable websites, and tease developers using other approaches to try and equal the performance.

The project is currently operational, meaning, roughly, that we have developed the thing (see details below).

### Justification
As estimated by the Website Carbon Calculator, ['the average web page tested produces approximately 0.5 grams CO2 per page view'](https://www.websitecarbon.com/). There are now [hundreds of millions of active websites](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/website-statistics/), and many more to come. Emissions add up. 

Since individual websites do not in themselves constitute the problem, it would be naive to expect individual website owners to single-handedly do everything it takes to make a website sustainable. There are time, cost, and knowledge barriers to consider. 

Website owners need resources that make it easier for them to make their websites more sustainable and is cost-efficient. These resources also need to consider the need for websites to be visually-appealing.

GatsbyJS is a robust framework to build sustainable websites. It is based on React, so it can handle almost everything you throw at it. That said, it ultimately generates static websites, which can be very sustainable (for numerous reasons). Not to say GatsbyJS websites are automatically sustainable. Much can be lost in implementation. 

We therefore aim to produce a GatsbyJS foundation that shows what GatsbyJS can achieve if used with sustainability in mind.

### Status
This project is currently operational. We have developed the foundation. We are currently testing it. We can already implement it as part of client projects. 

You are, in fact, looking at an implementation, i.e., this website â€“ source code [here](https://github.com/jbolns/polyzentrik).

We aim to publish an open-access version of our current implementation not including company and personal details. That said, we are still undergoing tests and polishing things. So, meanwhile, please do not use without explicit permission.

### Usage
**Coding services.** We can help people, businesses, and organisations implement GatsbyJS as part of their digital infrastructure.

**External usage.** Not yet applicable.
