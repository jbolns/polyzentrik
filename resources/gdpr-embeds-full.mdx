We are coding a React module that enables us to embed third-party content into dynamic websites in a way we think is GDPR-friendly. 

This project is currently being developed. It builds on a [static version of the module](../gdpr-embeds-static/) that we have already developed and are testing. Development will continue once the static version becomes final.

### Justification
Websites regularly embed content from other websites – for example, YouTube videos. Embeds often involve third-party cookies: the provider can serve Cookies to your visitors via the embed.

We have nothing against websites using Cookies as part of their embeds. They might legitimately need to do this. 

Regardless, embeds are a challenge for websites covered by the EU's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive (aka. the Cookie Law). Currently, the options available to a website covered by EU legislation are (1) to avoid using embeds or (2) to ask consent for myriad third-party Cookies in case a user ends up on a page with an embed. The first alternative is not great for user experience. It limits what users get from your website. The second alternative is not great for privacy. It forces users to decide if to accept third-party Cookies before knowing if they need or want to see a specific embed.

We have therefore produced and are improving a module that allows us to include embeds into *static* websites in a way that we believe is GDPR-friendly. A dynamic version is feasible by adding logging capacities, which we plan to do after the static version becomes final.

### Status
This particular project is under development. More information will become available as development advances.

That said, a static version of this module is currently operational. You can read details about it [here](../gdpr-embeds-static/).

### Feedback
We welcome feedback via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/polyzentrik). 

We are particularly interested on legal opinions about whether a dynamic website needs to log all consents. This is not an issue in static websites because these literally cannot log things – which constitutes a technological impossibility. However, we are dubious about whether it can be left as optional for dynamic websites. Technically, the loading of the embed constitutes proof of consent, so we are inclined to think logging can be optional. That said, we're not lawyers, so we are really not sure about this.
