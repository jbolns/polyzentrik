We have coded a React module that enables us to embed third-party content into static websites in a way we think is GDPR-friendly.

The project is currently operational, meaning, roughly, that we have developed the thing (see details below).

### Justification
Websites regularly embed content from other websites – for example, YouTube videos. Embeds often involve third-party cookies: the provider can serve Cookies to your visitors via the embed.

We have nothing against websites using Cookies as part of their embeds. They might legitimately need to do this. 

Regardless, embeds are a challenge for websites covered by the EU's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive (aka. the Cookie Law). Currently, the options available to a website covered by EU legislation are (1) to avoid using embeds or (2) to ask consent for myriad third-party Cookies in case a user ends up on a page with an embed. The first alternative is not great for user experience. It limits what users get from your website. The second alternative is not great for privacy. It forces users to decide if to accept third-party Cookies before knowing if they need or want to see a specific embed.

We have therefore produced and are improving a module that allows us to include embeds into our website in a way that Cookies only load if a user ends up in a page with an embed *and* accepts the Cookies from the specific third-party provider.

### Status
This static version of this module is currently operational. We have developed the foundation. We are currently testing it in our own website and can already implement it as part of client projects.

An implementation is now available [here](https://www.polyzentrik.com/blog/gdpr-embeds/) – source code [here](https://github.com/jbolns/polyzentrik/blob/main/src/components/embed.js).

Please note the source code for the implementation is not yet open source or open access. We aim to publish an open-access version but are still undergoing tests and polishing details. So, meanwhile, please do not use without explicit permission.

### Usage
**Coding services.** We can help people, businesses, and organisations implement GDPR embeds as part of their static websites and digital infrastructure.

**External usage.** Not yet applicable.
