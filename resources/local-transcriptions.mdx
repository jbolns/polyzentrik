This project produced a set of resources to undertake AI transcription locally (or on the 'edge') on relatively humble devices.

The scripts have been tested on a decent (CORE i7, 16MB RAM) but still affordable (€500) computer. Waiting times are significant, up to 3 or 4 times the audio length for the most complex script. That said, the quality of outputs is very satisfactory – comparable to commercial alternatives.

The scripts are now available as open-source resources via [GitHub](https://github.com/jbolns/transcription).

### Justification
Transcriptions are a surprisingly problematic data/AI ethics dilemma. Interviews, statements, and oral stories can hold delicate personal identifiable information (PII). Speakers often use names and readily disclose locations and sometimes even personal or confidential details under the assumption that the conversation will remain private. 

When recordings are transcribed online, all PII contained in them is transferred between several parties. This is not problematic if all due consents and safeguards are in place. However, using centralised transcription services becomes problematic without the appropriate consents and safeguards.

We therefore believe that while centralised/cloud-based transcription has a place in the market, alternatives are also needed. 

Our AI transcription scripts can run without a connection to the Internet (excl. downloading/reloading the necessary models, of course). They are one such alternative.

### Status
While we want to improve them further, we believe the scripts can already help produce better and more sustainable digital technologies. We have therefore open-sourced them via GitHub: [https://github.com/jbolns/transcription](https://github.com/jbolns/transcription).

The [license](https://github.com/jbolns/transcription/blob/main/LICENSE-2.0.txt) and copyright [NOTICE](https://github.com/jbolns/transcription/blob/main/NOTICE.txt) are also available on GitHub.

**! Please note.** The license specifically notes the scripts are offered without any guarantees. It is important that you are clear about this. We cannot guarantee there are no backdoors in the models used by the scripts or that data is fed back to providers in a way we have been unable to ascertain. The models were tested to work offline, which gives some peace of mind, but that is it.

### Related services
We also offer related services:

* **[Guided implementation](../../services/ai-transcriptions/).** We can help you implement the scripts as part of your own infrastructure.
* **[Managed transcriptions](../../services/ai-transcriptions/).** We offer transcription services for selected users/projects.


### Feedback
The scripts produced by this project can already be helpful, reason why we have open-sourced them. That said, we also welcome feedback about them to potentially improve the scripts in the future.

Please submit feedback by creating an issue on the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jbolns/transcription). Alternatively, you are also welcome to follow and message us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/polyzentrik).
