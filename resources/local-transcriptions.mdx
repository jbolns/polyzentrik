This project produced a set of resources to undertake AI transcription locally (or on the 'edge') on relatively humble devices.

The scripts were tested on a decent (CORE i7, 16MB RAM) but still affordable (€500) computer. Waiting times were significant, up to 3 or 4 times the audio length for the most complex script. That said, the quality of outputs was very satisfactory – comparable to commercial alternatives. It was therefore decided to release the scripts as open-source resources.

### Justification
Transcriptions are a surprisingly problematic data/AI ethics dilemma. Interviews, statements, and oral stories can hold delicate personal identifiable information (PII). Speakers often use names and readily disclose locations and sometimes even personal or confidential details under the assumption that the conversation will remain private. 

When recordings are transcribed online, all PII contained in them is transferred between several parties. This is not problematic if all due consents and safeguards are in place. However, using centralised transcription services becomes problematic without the appropriate consents and safeguards.

We therefore believe that while centralised/cloud-based transcription has a place in the market, alternatives are also needed. 

The AI transcription scripts produced by this project can run without a connection to the Internet (excl. downloading/reloading models). They are one such alternative.

### Status
The resources produced by this project made the departing point for [LOKAL (transcriptions)](../../products/lokal-transcriptions), a state-of-the-art app that enables users to easily perform AI transcriptions on their own computers.

The scripts remain [available via GitHub](https://github.com/jbolns/transcription) under an open-source license in case they are helpful for something else.

However, they are no longer actively maintained.
