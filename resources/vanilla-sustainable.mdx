We are working on a website foundation (or starter pack) (call it however you want to call it) that we hope becomes one of the sustainable bases for creating websites. 

The foundation aims to help developers able and willing to approach websites using vanilla code, tease developers using other approaches to try and equal the performance and produce methods to emulate more safely when using libraries and frameworks.

The project is currently operational, meaning, roughly, that we have developed the thing and are testing it – more details below.

### Justification
As estimated by the Website Carbon Calculator, ['the average web page tested produces approximately 0.5 grams CO2 per page view'](https://www.websitecarbon.com/). There are [hundreds of millions of active websites](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/website-statistics/) and many more to come. Emissions add up. 

Since each website constitutes only a tiny part of the problem, it would be naive to expect individual website owners to single-handedly do everything it takes to make a website sustainable. There are time, cost, and knowledge barriers to consider.

Website owners need resources that make it easier for them to make their websites more sustainable in a cost-efficient manner. These resources also need to consider the need for websites to be visually appealing.

Vanilla websites are rare. However, vanilla code bits can be implemented or emulated easily in numerous libraries and frameworks. Therein our interest in starting with a vanilla-code foundation. It can directly help developers who can use vanilla code. It can also form a basis for emulating ideas and methods elsewhere.

### Status
This project is currently operational. We have developed the foundation. We are testing it and can already implement it in client projects. 

An implementation is now available [here](https://www.josebolanos.xyz), our Founder's personal page – source code [here](https://github.com/jbolns/jbolns.github.io).

Please note the source code for the implementation is not open source or open access. We aim to publish an open-access version that does not include personal details. That said, we are still undergoing tests and polishing details. Meanwhile, please do not use without explicit permission.

### Related services
We also offer related services:
