We have developed WEIRD, a multimodal web framework able to produce websites from different types of documents, even Word documents. WEIRD has several noteworthy abilities, one of them being the capacity to produce fairly sustainable websites. 

WEIRD is now available under an open-source license via [GitHub](https://github.com/jbolns/WEIRD).

### Justification
WEIRD is both a no-code/low-code tool to make websites from documents (currently supported: .html, .md, .docx, and .docm) and a web framework developers can use to code multimodal websites.

In its no-code/low-code mode, WEIRD supports inclusivity. Installation is tricky and does require coding skills. That said, once installed, WEIRD is fairly easy to use. It comes with chat-based assistants anyone can use to easily build websites by answering questions and uploading documents/images. Once installed, if you can use Word, you can produce a website with WEIRD.

In full web framework mode, WEIRD supports sustainability. WEIRD can produce websites that are fairly sustainable, as measured by appropriate third-party tools and is best-suited for small to medium websites, which can be difficult to deliver sustainable because they are typically tied to the limitations of commercial tools that may or may not care about sustainability. It is impossible to guarantee a WEIRD website *will* be sustainable. Usage matters. However, used well, WEIRD can help coders produce fairly sustainable (small to medium) websites.

### Status
WEIRD is currently in Beta and as such, it is a highly experimental product. That said, we believe it can already be useful in many circumstances. Hence, WEIRD is available via GitHub: [https://github.com/jbolns/WEIRD](https://github.com/jbolns/WEIRD) under an open-source license.
