We have been experimenting with ways to use AI large language models (LLMs) to generate scientifically sound content. We have learned in the process that AI language models can help you do more than just a blog post. 

For example...

* **Blogging/marketing.** Our blog combines AI-generated blog posts with “behind-the-scenes” articles about the process and related limitations and opportunities. For instance, [we used Auto-GPT to create a list of sustainable coffee brands](../../blog/sustainable-coffee-autogpt/) and published a [companion about the process and lessons learned](../../blog/sustainable-coffee-behind-scenes/). The strategy has allowed us to create interesting content for our website and learn further about LLMs.

* **Product development.** We have used LLMs to generate content for product mockups. Say we need a website for a cake company. We ask an LLM to generate a profile for "Cakes 123", a fictitious company, alongside content for its website. We also ask for supporting images from an image model. We then build a website around this fictional company, gradually introducing text and images from the real-world client as/when these become available. The ultra-realistic mockups enable us to visualise the end product better than otherwise possible and can aid customer communications.

* **Project management.** We also recently helped develop a strategy to generate and improve the content of an e-commerce website. The website needed many product descriptions, hundreds of them. Manually writing so many descriptions can be exhausting and time-consuming. LLMs can facilitate workload management in such circumstances by providing foundational content that enables other parts of the project to move forward. 

Not to say challenges do not exist. **Using AI to generate a lot of content in a manner that is consistent and supports business objectives is harder than using it to write a single blog post.** 

Potential challenges include but are not limited to:
* Ensuring the AI content will indeed support your business strategy
* Ensuring that your AI content strategy is ethical
* Considering the room for potential mistakes by the LLM and strategies to manage them
* Thinking about the intended channels or website sections and the ideal tone/style/length for each
* Considering whether there will be a need for editing the AI content
* Defining strategies to reduce potential editing costs
* Preparing your AI content to facilitate editing.

As much as we are very supportive of AI's ability to help us improve how we do things, we also regularly emphasise that AI LLMs are still woefully imperfect experimental products. Do not take these challenges lightly. The consequences might surprise you.
