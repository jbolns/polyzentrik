Understanding your audience and staying ahead of market trends is vital for success. Interviews and focus groups are invaluable for this:
* *Customer understanding* – interviews/focus groups offer a direct line of communication with customers
* *Product development* – interviews/focus groups can help validate ideas and develop products that appeal to customers
* *Strategic decision-making* – interviews/focus groups can serve as a foundation for informed decisions
* *Competitive advantage* – interviews/focus groups can provide insights into your and competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, helping you develop strategies that set you apart.

Yet, the modern business environment is fast-paced. Manually transcribing and analysing interviews and focus groups can take significant time.

There is often a need for streamlined processes to efficiently extract insights from interviews and focus groups.
