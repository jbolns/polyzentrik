While not commonly talk about, transcriptions are often quite helpful in numerous settings:
* *Research* – Interviews are incredibly common in any research context, and typically need to be transcribed
* *Business* – Businesses often also need to transcribe interviews and focus groups undertaken as part of product or strategy research
* *Analytics* – Transcriptions are needed to convert spoken interactions into data for advanced analytics
* *Events* – Seminars, panels, and conferences are vital to exchanging knowledge and can be transcribed for easier dissemination
* *Social media* – Transcriptions can help to facilitate access to and increase engagement for reels and podcasts
* *Content generation* – Converting spoken interactions into written content can be a way to multiply your marketing content.

However, manual transcription can be incredibly time-consuming, and paid transcriptions can be costly when audios are long or there is many of them. 

### Our services
Polyzentrik is here to help! 

**Our AI transcription services and resources can help you save time and money.** 

In initial tests with 1- and 2-hour-long open interviews, which would take days to transcribe manually, the models delivered transcripts for which editing took just hours. Based on the user’s input, the quality seemed comparable to more expensive alternatives.

Check out some of the available options below and [**get in touch**](mailto:hello@polyzentrik.com) to discuss possibilities!
