Transcriptions are common in many settings, often done using AI-enabled cloud-based services. 

While incredibly helpful in many circumstances, cloud-based transcriptions are not always optimal solutions. Costs can increase rapidly if the audios are long or if there are many audios. Additionally, privacy and ethical concerns can exist:
* Do participants know third parties are transcribing their audios?
* Do participants understand these third parties use AI?
* Did participants consent to sharing personally identifiable information (PII) intentionally or unintentionally contained in the audios?
* Are participants informed of the AI providers’ data policies and procedures?
* Are researchers even allowed to ask for consent to use services that are not always clear in how they handle data?

Sometimes (and we emphasise only sometimes), there is a need for AI transcription resources that at least partially address these challenges.

### Our open-source resources
We have produced a set of scripts that can help individuals and organisations to undertake AI transcriptions locally (on the 'edge'). 

While we cannot guarantee there are no backdoors in the models or that data is fed back to model providers in a way we have been unable to ascertain, the scripts have been tested offline (without a connection to the internet)<sup>1</sup> on a decent (CORE i7, 16MB RAM) but still affordable (€500) computer. Waiting times are significant, but the quality of outputs is comparable to commercial alternatives.

The scripts are available under an open-source license. More information is available [here](../../resources/local-transcriptions).

### Our services
We can also help people, businesses, and organisations implement the scripts as part of their own infrastructure and, in select cases, handle transcriptions for them using our equipment.

There is limited availability. [**Get in touch**](mailto:hello@polyzentrik.com) to reserve!
