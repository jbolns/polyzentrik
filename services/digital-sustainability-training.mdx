Digital sustainability training can give you or your organisation the skills needed to:
* **Reduce operational costs** by optimising energy use and minimising electronic waste
* **Enhancing your brand** by showcasing your commitment to sustainability
* **Navigate compliance and mitigate risk** by promoting understanding and adherence to environmental regulations
* **Foster innovation and efficiency** by identifying opportunities for innovation
* **Enhance employee engagement and retention** by potentially fostering a culture of care within your organisation and boosting morale.

Digital sustainability training can therefore strongly benefit you and your organisation by giving you the skills to thrive in an increasingly green-minded world while reducing costs and having a positive impact on the planet.

### Our open-source resources
We have produced a syllabus for a mini-course on digital sustainability. The course is suitable for students, managers, policymakers, and programmers and is available under an open-source license. More information is available [here](../../resources/ds-101/).

### Our services
We can also deliver digital sustainability training online or at your premises. You benefit from expert training and a certificate of participation for each attendant. Depending on the percentage of people trained, we can also explore the possibility of verifying you as a trained organisation.

There is limited availability. [**Get in touch**](mailto:hello@polyzentrik.com) to reserve!
