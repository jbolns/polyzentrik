Good management of sustainability challenges can help you **develop regulations** (if you are a policy actor), **meet regulations** (if you are a private actor), **access better finance**, and **improve your reputation**.

We can help your sustainability initiatives be successful – especially if it involves certification, data-driven ESG/SDGs, and/or digital sustainability.

* **Open source resources.** We have published an [open-source syllabus for a mini-course on digital sustainability](../../resources/ds-101/) that can help you take first steps towards sustainability if your business or organisation has significant digital activities.
* **Services.** We can also provide you hourly, daily, and weekly support for your projects – check some of the available options below and [**get in touch**](mailto:hello@polyzentrik.com) to discuss possibilities!

<p class='small'>(Please note, we do <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> charge for initial or preliminary consultations. The rates below are indicative of costs for formally-agreed projects. Unless we have given you a quote and you have accepted it, we will NOT charge you for asking things, getting in touch, or having a conversation like normal humans.)</p>

<p class='small m-0'>1. Travel and other expenses not included in rates.</p>
<p class='small m-0'>2. Coding support is intended to help others design and develop digital tools and infrastructure, not code ourselves. Unless the project is trivial, a few days are not enough to review the codebase and contribute code.</p>
<p class='small m-0'>3. Coding is possible as part of the tasks, but this rate is not applicable to full-time coding assignments.</p>
