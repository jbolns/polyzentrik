There are many good reasons to consider using AI to complements a broader content strategy:

* *Efficiency* – rapid content generation can save time and resources for core sustainability activities
* *Consistency* – language models ensure tone and style consistency, which can strengthen brand identity
* *Personalisation* – AI allows for tailored content, increasing the effectiveness of campaigns targeting specific audiences
* *Scalability* – automated content generation enables higher content volume in multiple languages, expanding audience reach
* *Improvement* – AI models learn, and results can improve over time.

In short, AI can help you scale sustainability messaging and drive engagement. 

But risks also exist and are significant, especially in a science- and evidence-driven context like sustainability:

* *Ethical concerns* – using AI to generate content may raise ethical questions
* *Loss of human touch* – relying heavily on AI may diminish the authenticity and relatability of the message
* *Quality control* – AI models can generate content that is inaccurate, off-brand, or contextually inappropriate
* *Privacy* and *security* – training AI models requires access to and processing of large datasets, raising a need for strict protocols and practices.

To harness the potential of AI, thus, sustainability actors need to consider the risks and implement strategies to mitigate them. This can be challenging.
