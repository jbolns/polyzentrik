Sustainability reporting is now more critical than ever, for several reasons:
* *Compliance* – a wave of sustainability reporting regulations have or will soon become effective in Europe 
* Access to better *finance* – banks and investors globally now often ask for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk disclosure and information about the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
* *Marketing* – customers are willing to reward companies with good sustainability credentials.

The challenge can be significant, however:
* Business organisations do not always fully *understand sustainability*
* Complex *data* integration, analysis, and communication efforts are involved
* Learning how to use *new software* can be required
* Developing *digital tools* to meet specific needs could be necessary.
