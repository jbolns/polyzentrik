Tailored software solutions have numerous advantages over off-the-shelf alternatives:
* **Strategic alignment.** Tailored software can support your organisational goals better than off-the-shelf solutions.
* **Continuous improvement.** Tailored software can be approached under a continuous improvement / continuous development (CI/CD) strategy that delivers better and better outcomes over time.
* **Scalability.** Tailored software can grow/scale alongside your organisation in ways off-the-shelf solutions cannot.
* **Privacy.** Tailored software can give you better insight and control over your customer’s data.
* **Efficiency.** Tailored software solutions can be more efficient than off-the-shelf alternatives, thereby reducing costs.
* **Long-term cost management.** Tailored software can reduce licensing costs in the long term.
* **Sustainability.** Tailored software solutions can help you be more sustainable.

But there are challenges. Digital transformation projects are infamous for having outrageously high failure rates. 

Additionally, and this bothers us, although many software providers have the technical abilities to deliver ethical and sustainable solutions, many do not have the culture to turn words into action.

### Our (open) resources
We have several open-source or open-access resources that can help you develop better and more sustainable tailored software.
* **[DS 101](../../resources/ds-101/).** A seminar/course emphasising the connection between doing digital things sustainably and the ability to save and make money from it. It can help managers and coders alike understand digital sustainability challenges better.
* **[GDPR embeds](../../resources/gdpr-embeds-static/).** A module to help developers easily embed external content into static websites in a way that is compatible with EU regulations. It can help you bring external content into your projects in a way that considers applicable regulations.
* **[Vanilla sustainable](../../resources/vanilla-sustainable/).** A vanilla-code foundation demonstrating digital sustainability can be delivered alongside cost reductions, high performance, and appealing visuals. The foundation might also help coders get ideas to implement in their websites, irrespective of whether they are coding vanilla-style or using libraries/frameworks.
* **[Gatsby sustainable](../../resources/gatsby-sustainable/).** A foundation to inspire and help GatsbyJS developers build fast and highly sustainable websites with minimal running costs.

... More open-source or open-access projects/resources will come over time.

### Our services
Since we do not yet have the experience of larger commercial software companies, we are approaching tailored software development cautiously by prioritising completion over speed. 

In other words, we can help you develop tailored software that runs efficiently and considers society and the environment. We just won’t do it against the clock.
