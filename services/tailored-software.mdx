Tailored software solutions have many advantages over off-the-shelf alternatives, such as **better alignment with strategic goals**, the ability to work under a **continuous improvement / continuous development (CI/CD)** mentality, and a potential for **better scalability, privacy, and efficiency**. 

But there are challenges. Digital transformation projects are infamous for having outrageously high failure rates. 

We can help you develop your own software solutions, or develop them for you.

* **Open source resources.** We have developed and will continue to develop open-source resources that can help you develop better and more sustainable software, such as [DS 101](../../resources/ds-101/) and [WEIRD](../../resources/weird/).
* **Services.** We are approaching tailored software development cautiously by prioritising completion over speed of development – check some of the available options below and [**get in touch**](mailto:hello@polyzentrik.com) to discuss possibilities!
