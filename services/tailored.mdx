Fast websites are good for business and the environment.

Having a website that is, all, fast, beautiful, and sustainable can help you:
* Improve user experience (UX) – quick loading speeds are nowadays key to the ability to retain users in your website
* Increase conversion rates – a seamless navigation experience can contribute to longer visits and higher conversion rates
* Solidify your competitive advantage – a fast and well-designed website showcases your commitment to excellence
* Improve SEO rankings – fast and efficient load times contribute to SEO and therefore increase your site's visibility
* Increase brand reputation – users across the planet increasingly value a company's commitment to sustainability
* Save money – sustainable websites can reduce energy consumption, hosting bills, and the need for carbon offsets.

It really is that simple. When it comes to website design, business success and environmental responsibility go hand in hand.
