                    <p>Polyzentrik is a mission- rather than product-oriented company.</p>
                    <p className='reply'>What's this mission?</p>
                    <p><strong>To help build better and more sustainable digital technologies</strong>.</p>
                    <p className='reply'>How?</p>
                    <p>... We don't know the full answer to this question. No one does!</p>
                    <p>That said, our long-term strategy is to make many small good things that add up to a toolkit for building digital technologies more ethically and sustainably. We might also, in due course, think about certifying systems using these or equally-ethical/sustainable resources.</p>

                    <p className='reply'>And short-term, how can you help already today?</p>
                    <p>Two ways.<br />
                        1. <strong>Check our resources.</strong> We are producing resources addressing specific but very important challenges â€“ these might already help you approach digital technologies better and more sustainably.</p>
                    <p>2. <strong>Check our services.</strong> We code (or help you code) in a way that considers resource-utilisation across the entire chain (server energy, CO2, data requirements, etc.). This helps build solutions that perform, are cost-efficient, and keep society and the environment in mind.</p>
