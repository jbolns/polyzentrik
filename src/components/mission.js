          <p className='reply'>What's this mission?</p>
          <p><strong>To help build better and more sustainable digital technologies</strong>.</p>
          <p className='reply'>How?</p>
          <p>... We don't know the full answer to this question. No one does!</p>
          <p>That said, our long-term strategy is to make many small good things that add up to a toolkit for building digital technologies more ethically and sustainably.</p>

          <p className='reply'>And short-term, how can you help already today?</p>
          <p><strong>Check our resources.</strong> We are producing resources addressing specific but very important challenges â€“ these might already help you approach digital technologies better and more sustainably.</p>
          <p><strong>Ask about bespoke services.</strong> We code (and can help you code) in a way that considers resource-utilisation across the entire chain (server energy, CO2, data requirements, etc.). This helps build solutions that perform, are cost-efficient, and keep society and the environment in mind.</p>
